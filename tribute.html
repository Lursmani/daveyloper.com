            <p id="tribute-info">Laika (Russian: Лайка; c. 1954 – 3 November 1957) was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first
                 animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. Laika, a stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow, was selected
                  to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into outer space on 3 November 1957. <br> <br>

                Little was known about the impact of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the technology
                 to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be 
                 unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor 
                 to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure 
                 a micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living 
                 organisms react to spaceflight environments. <br> <br>
                
                Laika died within hours from overheating, possibly caused by a failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload.
                 The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her 
                 oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion. <br><br>
                
                On 11 April 2008, Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika. A small monument in her honour was built near the military 
                research facility in Moscow that prepared Laika's flight to space. It portrayed a dog standing on top of a rocket. She also 
                appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow.</p>
